      <h1>About this Site</h1>
      <p>This is a static page hosted outside of the Angular app, but should be one of the assets compiled into the distribution.</p>
      <p>It's important to understand how Google indexes single page applications. In order to accomplish this, we've built a site that can be used to understand how content is crawled.</p>
      <p>We have two variations of this site.</p>
      <p>One variation uses a "hashbang" style navigation. This approach is preferable, because it doesn't impose the need for redirects to be configured to a particular page. However, this approach could be intrinsically problematic.</p>
      <p>Another variation uses the pushstate approach. Although the URLs look "clean" (because the don't contain a #!) it simply won't work without comprehensive control over which pages handle a particular path.</p>
      <p>What we are attempting to understand is how indexing of "pages" works for each variation. It would also be great to understand if links to other sites count as backlinks.</p>
      <p>I've created a link to <a href="https://wl-demo.goodshuffle.com/">Our Wishlist demo site</a> to determine if this page receives a backlink from the variations of our site.</p>
      <p>The Angular components will link to other sites, but links to these sites will be controlled dynamically based on the window location. That way, we should be able to discern a difference in the way pages are navigated and/or backlinks are detected.</p>
